## What is Churn Management?
----
The dynamics of peer participation, or churn, are an inherent property of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems and critical for design and evaluation. Accurately characterizing churn requires precise and unbiased information about the arrival and departure of peers, which is challenging to acquire.

We can briefly define churn as the process of peers leaving and entering the system continuously.
