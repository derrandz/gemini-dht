Welcome to wiki of the the peer-to-peer layer of Pocket Network 1.0!

In this Wiki all information relative to the Gemini specification and implementation, respecting the following order:

1. [Routing Structure and Algorithms](./Routing-Algorithm-And-Structure.md)

   In the first part of this Wiki, we attend in detail to the backbone data-structure of the routing for Hydrate as well as the algorithm and give detailed insight into scalability and performance.


2. [Churn Management](./Churn-Management.md)
   
   In the second part, we lay down the mechanisms and strategies for peer discovery, join and leave and overall network maintenance

3. [Node Identification & Security](./Node-Identification-And-Security.md)
   
   In the third, we describe the the requirements the node identification and security requirements the network has to meet to support the other parts.

4. [Transport Protocols & Security](./Transport-Logic-And-Security.md)

   Fourthly but not lastly, we touch on the transport layer of Hydrate and its maintenance and management.

5. [Peer Logic & Features](./Peer-Logic-And-Features.md)
   
   On the fifth, we describe the smarter part of the network that enables the chain, primarily dealing with how to classify peers per role, enforcing bans, and sending specific message types using specific communication models as well as handling stateful communication, such as neighboring chain heights and what not.

6. [Messages In The Overlay](./Messages-In-The-Overlay.md)
 
   In this section, we specify the currently known and allowed message types in the peer-to-peer layer.

7. [Usability Interface / Interfacing with Other Modules](./Usability-Interface.md)
