## Overview
----

In this section, we illustrate the smarter part of the network, the part that leverages the overlay functionalities to serve the other modules and ultimately the chain.

In specific terms, this section deals with communication models (_or specialized communication scenarios_) and the awareness models the network can make use of (_aware as in aware of the state it needs to perform this specialized communication_) and subsequently the architectural decisions they might engender.
