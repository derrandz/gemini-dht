## Overview
---

Gemini assigns every Peer an ID typically 64-bit or 128-bit long. 

These IDs could be derived from a key using a hash function like SHA1 if the application already has an ID/key that doesn't fit the requirements for Gemini to work.

The requirement for node Identification are: 
1. ID should be unique
2. Consistent bit size for ID
3. Generation of IDs is uniformly distributed in the ID space
